Data Science Project for the Advanced Data Science course at Zeppelin University. 

The aim of this website is to analyse and visualise Airbnb data in Copenhagen and identify the price determinants of its rentals. In particular, it scrapes coordinats of its metro station in order to
investigate the effect of the distance to the closest metro station on the price of the rental.
It uses data from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).
